In this thesis I will present the article `Digital topology on graphs`.
I will cover finite topological spaces and their connection to partial
orders and cell complexes. Additionally, I will present how topological
properties of images can be analyzed using compatible topologies on graphs, as well
as discuss their existence and properties.
